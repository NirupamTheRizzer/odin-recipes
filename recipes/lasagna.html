    <p><strong>Lasagna Recipe</strong></p>
    <p>To assemble a classic lasagna, begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C) and spreading a thin layer of meat sauce across the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish to prevent sticking
. Arrange a single layer of cooked or oven-ready lasagna noodles over the sauce, overlapping them slightly if necessary to cover the base. Next, spread a third of the prepared ricotta (or cottage cheese) mixture evenly over the noodles, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese and then a generous amount of meat sauce. Repeat this layering sequence twice more, starting with noodles, then the cheese mixture, and finishing with the meat sauce. Top the final layer of noodles with the remaining sauce, sprinkle generously with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, and cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil (sprayed on the inside to prevent sticking). Bake the covered lasagna for about 25 to 45 minutes, then remove the foil and bake uncovered for another 10 to 25 minutes until the top is golden brown and bubbly. Crucially, allow the lasagna to rest for at least 15 minutes after removing it from the oven before slicing and serving, which helps the layers set and prevents it from becoming a runny mess.
